# simple-deno-server

A simple CRUD API using Deno 1.0.0

## What is Deno?

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8. It was created to fix some regrets and challenges that the creator of Node.js had.

See more at https://deno.land/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software)

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iagobruno/simple-deno-server.git
cd simple-deno-server
deno run --allow-net main.ts

The server should now be running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
